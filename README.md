# How To Install Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) Stack on Ubuntu 22.04

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a web-based application using the LAMP stack. The LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) stack is a popular open-source web development platform used for building dynamic websites and web applications.

## Prerequisites

- AWS EC2 Instance: An EC2 instance will be used as the hosting environment for the LAMP stack. It provides scalability and flexibility for web development projects.

- AWS Security Group Configuration: Ensure that all traffic is allowed in the AWS Security Group associated with your EC2 instance. However, this is not a recommended practice for production environments, and security configurations should be adjusted accordingly.

- Choose Ubuntu OS: Select Ubuntu as the operating system when configuring your EC2 instance. Ubuntu is widely used and well-supported, making it a suitable choice for hosting web applications.
